v1.1.0:
- Updated core
  - Imposed restrictions on accessing external directories.
  - There is no need to pass the config data to GulpJsonLoader, now it's optional
    and defined from defaults. But if you want to change them, you might tune it in
    both ways: using an old-style passing an object with options to GulpJsonLoader
    factory or just pass the settings into a package.json. See package.json.

- Updated dependencies
  - gulp-load-plugins: ^2.0.7
  - gulp-pug: ^5.0.0
